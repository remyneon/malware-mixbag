Cracking Island exists as a tor site - http://cisland46psf56panbm2japxoxeguqekmataim54kn2ysucnk3yo7eyd.onion

They say:

*"Stop searching in forums and unsafe websites

Every software here is 100% free of virus

If there is an issue, just report it"*


In reality all their tools have banking trojans and stealers attached. This is a small collection of the "tools" they provide.

They used to provide VT links for clean files with different hashes. Now they have gotten lazier and even their fake hashes have hits:
